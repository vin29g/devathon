      <p>

      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The <b>Webmaster</b> of the Web Team, and <b>administrators</b> of the Web Team who are entrusted with content management do not come under the scope of this web policy. However, the spirit that governs this article remains same for all, and restrictions on website content apply to the administrators and webmaster as well. However, since the web team enforces the Web Policy, webmaster and administrators cannot be charged under the web team. Arbitrations and defenses may be made to the incharge of the section.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Posting content that may be deemed <b>inappropriate</b> is strictly discouraged and is actionable. Inappropriate content includes content that is offensive to a section of the user space, untrue (see section 4), or inciting hatred/passions among a section of site users. Content that explicitly does not support any one of the above categories but has negative implications also comes under this category. Advertisements and brand building are also considered inappropriate. Actions may include sections 12 and 13. Strongly-worded arguments and constructive criticism do not come under the purview of this section.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>

When posting such material, a link to the source may be given (if necessary to follow copyright terms).
      </p>

In case of dispute, the Web Team will form a committee of web team members, the defendant, and the impersonated individual to probe into the matter and submit recommendations. Action taken by the Web Team is bound by the recommendations given. Repeated offences will invite action in sections 12 and 13.
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
        Attempted <b>cracking, hacking</b> or otherwise launching a denial-of-service (<b>DoS</b>) attack on the site / server hosting the site is not allowed.
